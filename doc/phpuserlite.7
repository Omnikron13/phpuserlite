.SH CONFIGURATION
.I phpuserlite
can be configured by changing a number of class constants in the
.B User
class. These constants can be found at the top of the class
declaration. For the most part these settings can be left as
their default values and
.I phpuserlite
will work fine, with the exception of
.IR DB_PATH ,
.RI "the " "CONFIRM_*" " constants,"
.RI "and the " "SET_EMAIL_CONFIRM_*" " constants."
Following is a complete list of the configuration constants
available to you
.\" const User::DB_PATH
.SS DB_PATH
You should set this constant to the fully qualified path to the
.I SQLite
database file you want
.I phpuserlite
to use. The default value is the path to the database used to
develop and test
.I phpuserlite
.\" const User::SALT_LENGTH
.SS SALT_LENGTH
This is the number of bytes of random data used to salt data
that is hashed by
.IR phpuserlite .
The default value is
.IR 16 ,
which should be sufficient, so you
probably do not need to alter this
.\" const User::SESSION_KEY_LENGTH
.SS SESSION_KEY_LENGTH
This is the number of bytes of random data that is used to
generate the session keys used in login cookies. The default
value is
.IR 32 ,
which should be sufficient, so you probably do not need to
alter this
.SS CONFIRM_CODE_LENGTH
This is the number of bytes of random data that is used to
generate the confirmation codes sent to users to confirm
registration and change of email. The default value is
.IR 16 ,
which should be sufficient, so you probably do not need to
alter this
.SS HASH_ALGORITHM
This is the hashing algorithm that
.I phpuserlite
uses throughout, with the exception of
.BR generateConfirmCode (),
which uses
.I sha1
for brevity. The default value is
.IR sha512 ,
but if you wish to use another hashing algorithm, you may
set this to any algorithm available to the php
.IR hash ()
function
.SS HASH_ITERATIONS
This is the number of times a password is passed through 
.B HASH_ALGORITHM
before being stored in, or checked against, the database.
The default value is
.IR 256 ,
which should be sufficient, so you probably do not need to
alter this
.SS USERNAME_REGEX
This defines the prototype that all usernames of users managed
by
.I phpuserlite
must conform to.
.I phpuserlite
will refuse to register users who wish to register with
usernames that do not conform to this regex, and will ask
them to enter another username. The default value is
.I /^\[rs]w{4,32}$/
.SS PASSWORD_REGEX
This defines the prototype that all passwords of users managed
by
.I phpuserlite
must conform to.
.I phpuserlite
will refuse to register users who wish to register with
passwords that do not conform to this regex, and will ask
them to enter another password. The default value is
.IR /^.{6,128}$/ .
It is recommended that you only modify the minimum and maximum
characters, and then that you only increase them
.SS EMAIL_REGEX
This is the regex used to attempt to assure that all users are
registered with a valid email address. The default value is
.IR /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/i ,
which you should only change if are sure it will continue to
work, or if you wish to be more strict on who can register
.SS COOKIE_SESSION_LENGTH
This is the time in seconds before a login session cookie will
expire, thus the amount of time a user will stay logged in
unless they logout manually. The default value is
.IR 604800 ,
which equates to 7 weeks
.\" User::COOKIE_PATH
.SS COOKIE_PATH
This is the value that will be used for the path attribure of
all cookies issued by
.IR phpuserlite .
The default value is an empty string
.SS COOKIE_DOMAIN
This is the value that will be used for the domain attribute of
all cookies issued by
.IR phpuserlite .
The default value is an empty string
.SS LOGIN_FORM_TEMPLATE
This is the template used by
.I phpuserlite
to generate login forms. When modifying this template, pay
attention to the
.IR [form_action] ", " [error] " & " [username]
placeholders, they are used to inject information into the
template
.SS LOGIN_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE

to report a successful login. When modifying this template
pay attention to the
.I [username]
placeholder, it is used to inject the username of the user
that has logged in
.SS REGISTER_FORM_TEMPLATE
This is the template used by
.I phpuserlite
to generate registration forms. When modifying this template,
pay attention to the

constants labelled as
.IR flags ;
.BR GET_BY_ID ,
.BR GET_BY_USERNAME ,
.BR SET_EMAIL_CONFIRM " &"

These constants are NOT for configuraton, they are for passing
to methods as flags to alter the methods behaviour, and as such
they should NOT be modified
.\" +------------------------+
.\" | STATIC METHODS SECTION |
.\" +------------------------+
.SH STATIC METHODS
The static methods in
.I phpuserlite
are used to add users to the database, display & process forms,
and perform initial setup
.SS getCurrent\fR()
This method attempts to identify the current logged in user by
login cookies, returning a
.B User
object on success, otherwise
.I NULL
.SS add\fR(\fIusername\fR, \fIpassword\fR, \fIemail\fR)
This method adds a new user into the
.I users
table of the database, provided that;
.I username
matches against
.BR USERNAME_REGEX ,
.I password
matches against
.BR PASSWORD_REGEX ,
.I email
matches against
.BR EMAIL_REGEX ,
and
.IR username " & " email
are not already in the database. This method has no return value
through might throw one of
.BR UserInvalidUsernameException ,
.BR UserInvalidPasswordException ,
.BR UserInvalidEmailException ,
.BR UserUnavailableUsernameException ,
.BR UserUnavailableEmailException
if there is an error. Note that this method does not pass through
email verification, so should be used sparingly
.SS addPending\fR(\fIusername\fR, \fIpassword\fR, \fIemail\fR)
This method adds a new user into the
.I usersPending
table of the database and sends out a confirmation email to
.I email
generated from the
.BR CONFIRM_SUBJECT ", " CONFIRM_BODY_TEMPLATE " & " CONFIRM_FROM
constants, provided that;
.I username
matches against
.BR USERNAME_REGEX ,
.I password
matches against
.BR PASSWORD_REGEX ,
.I email
matches against
.BR EMAIL_REGEX ,
and
.IR username " & " email
are not already in the database. This method has no return value
though might throw one of
.BR UserInvalidUsernameException ,
.BR UserInvalidPasswordException ,
.BR UserInvalidEmailException ,
.BR UserUnavailableUsernameException ,
.BR UserUnavailableEmailException
if there is an error. Note that there must be a page set up with
the
.BR confirm ()
method to verify that
.I email
exists and is owned by the user for the data to be tranfered to
the
.I users
table in the database, activating the user and allowing them to
log in
.\" static function User::confirm()
.SS confirm\fR()
This method processes a confirmation code, as emailed out to new
users by
.BR addPending (),
transfering the relevant user from the
.I usersPending
to the
.I users
table in the database. The return value is always a string
containing 
.B CONFIRM_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE
on success or one of
.BR CONFIRM_INCORRECT_CODE_TEMPLATE ", " CONFIRM_NO_SUCH_ID_TEMPLATE
on failure, to be displayed to the user
.\" static function User::confirmSetEmail()
.SS confirmSetEmail\fR()
This method processes a change of email confirmation code, as
emailed out to users by
.BR setEmail ()
when called with the
.B SET_EMAIL_CONFIRM
flag, transfering the relevant email address from the
.I usersChangeEmail
table to the corresponding user entry in the
.I users
table in the database. The return value is always a string
containing a message of success or failure to be displayed to
the user
.\" static function User::login()
.SS login\fR()
This method is used to generate & process login forms, and will
behave differently if called in different contexts, but the
return value is always a
.IR string .
If it is called without a login attempt in
.IR $_POST []
it will generate and return a login form from
.BR LOGIN_FORM_TEMPLATE ,
injecting only into the
.I [form_action]
placeholder. If it is called with a login attempt in
.IR $_POST []
and the login is unsuccessful it will generate a login form from
.BR LOGIN_FORM_TEMPLATE ,
injecting into the
.IR [form_action ", " [error] " & possibly " [username]
placeholders. If it is called with a login attempt in
.IR $_POST []
and the login is successful it will generate and return a success
message from
.BR LOGIN_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE .
Note that this method must be called before any output as it
needs to set cookies
.\" static function User::register()
.SS register\fR()
This method is used to generate & process registration forms,
and will behave differently if called in different contexts, but
the return value is always a
.IR string .
If it is called without a registration attempt in
.IR $_POST []
it will generate and return a registration form from
.BR REGISTER_FORM_TEMPLATE ,
injecting only into the
.I [form_action]
placeholder. If it is called with a registration attempt in
.IR $_POST []
and the registration is unsuccessful it will generate and return
a registration form from
.BR REGISTER_FORM_TEMPLATE ,
injecting to the
.IR [form_action] ", " [error]
& possibly
.IR [username] " and/or " [email]
placeholders. If it is called with a registration attempt in
.IR $_POST []
and the registration is successful it will add a new user to the
.I usersPending
table in the database, send out a confirmation email and
generate and return a success message from
.B REGISTER_SUCCESS_TEMPLATE
.\" static function User::setupDB()
.SS setupDB\fR()
This method must be called after you set
.B DB_PATH ,
but before you attempt to call any methods or create any
.B User
objects. You only need to call this once, unless you delete or
move the database, or alter
.BR DB_PATH ,
and wish to recreate the database from scratch
.\" +--------------------------+
.\" | INSTANCE METHODS SECTION |
.\" +--------------------------+
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.\" User class constructor
.SS Constructor\fR(\fIuid\fR, \fIgetType\fR)
The class constructor for
.B User
treats
.I uid
differently depending on the value of
.IR getType ,
which can be one of the flags
.BR GET_BY_ID " or " GET_BY_USERNAME .
If
.I getType
is set to
.B GET_BY_ID
then the constructor looks for a user in the
.I users
table in the database where
.I id
matches
.I uid
and creates a
.B User
object if it finds one, otherwise it throws an
.IR OutOfBoundsException .
If
.I getType
is set to
.B GET_BY_USERNAME
then the constructor looks for a user in the
.I users
table in the database where
.I username
matches
.I uid
and creates a
.B User
object if it finds one, otherwise it throws an
.IR OutOfBoundsException .
The constructor may also throw one of
.I InvalidArgumentException
or
.B UserInvalidUsernameException
if
.I uid
is invalid
.\" public function [user-object]->getType()
.SS getID\fR()
.SS getUsername\fR()
.SS getPassword\fR()
.SS getSalt\fR()
.SS getEmail\fR()
.SS getDate\fR()
.SS getSessionKey\fR()
.SS getSessionIP\fR()
.SS setUsername\fR(\fIusername\fR)
.SS setPassword\fR(\fIpassword\fR)
.SS setEmail\fR(\fIemail\fR, \fImode\fR)
.SS checkPassword\fR(\fIpassword\fR)
.SS startSession\fR()
.SS checkSession\fR(\fIsessionKey\fR)
.\" public function [user-object]->endSession()
.SS endSession\fR()
This method clears all of the cookies issued by
.I phpuserlite
and clears the
.IR sessionKey " & " sessionIP
data from the
.B User
object and corresponding data in the
.I users
table of the database. This is probably the best and easiest way
to implement a logout page. Note that this method must be called
before any output as it needs to set cookies
