::: OVERVIEW :::
phpuserlite is a PHP module that provides a class (User) for managing the basic
functionality of a user system for websites including; login & registration
forms, email confirmation, username/password/email validation, password
processing etc. The design is focussed on a high level of security while
maintaining ease of use and configuration, and uses SQLite to handle the
underlying database.

::: REQUIREMENTS :::
phpuserlite has been tested to work on PHP 5.3 or higher, use on PHP 5.2 or
earlier is not supported. phpuserlite also requires the mcrypt, PDO and SQLite
PDO driver PHP extensions, though PDO and PDO_SQLITE should be included with
PHP. SQLite version 3.6.19 or later is required to use the foreign key
constraint in the usersChangeEmail table schema.
mcrypt extension:  http://php.net/manual/book.mcrypt.php
PDO extension:     http://php.net/manual/book.pdo.php
SQLite PDO driver: http://pecl.php.net/package/PDO_SQLITE

::: INSTALLATION :::
To install phpuserlite, simply ensure that you have all the dependencies listed
above, then copy User.php to wherever in your PHP include path you wish to keep
library code. Optionally copy doc/phpuserlite.7 into section 7 of your manual,
which would typically be /usr/share/man/man7

::: EXAMPLE :::
A quick example of setting up phpuserlite for use, assuming a config file called
example.cfg is located in the same directory as User.php, and then adding a new
user to the database

<?php
require_once('User.php');
User::loadConfig('example.cfg');
User::setupDB();
User::add('a_user', 'password', 'user@example.com');
?>

Documentation of these methods, and the rest of the functionality of phpuserlite
can be found in the included man page (doc/phpuserlite.7)
