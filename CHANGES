phpuserlite change log
----------------------

v2.0.0-rc.3 -SUBJECT TO CHANGE TILL TAGGED
    Database:
        Removed the usersOnDelete trigger again, in favour of ON DELETE &
        ON UPDATE clauses on applicable FOREIGN KEY constraints.
v2.0.0-rc.2
    Database:
        Added a usersOnDelete trigger to the database with the default
        schema automatically deleting rows from usersChangeEmail just
        before their parent row in users is deleted to prevent foreign key
        issues.
        Foreign key constraints are now enforced throughout User
    API:
        Added __toString() method, which returns the username.
        Added eight new custom exceptions - UserInvalidModeException,
        UserIncorrectDatatypeException, UserNegativeValueException,
        UserNegativeTimestampException, UserFutureTimestampException,
        UserNoSuchUseException, UserFileUnreadableException and
        UserNoSuchConfigParameterException.
        Changed the cookie duration argument of startSession to be optional
        with the default being 0, bringing the code back in line with the
        man pages claim that the default is session cookies.
        Added a new public getDB() method, which returns a PDO object
        representing the database User is (currently) using

v2.0.0-rc.1
    Security:
        Added a new system that temporarily blocks login attempts, on a per
        user basis, when it detects suspect login attempt activity as a
        measure to prevent brute-force attacks
    Database:
        Two columns necessary for the new brute-force prevention system
        added to the users table schema.
        Foreign key constraint added to the default usersChangeEmail table
        schema, keying the userID column to the id column in the users
        table.
	Table schema moved into the configuration system
    API:
        Configuration constants replaced with protected static array of
        config parameters initially populated with class defaults and
        overwritable using 'ini style' config files.
        New config() & loadConfig() public static methods for accessing and
        initialising the new configuration system respectively.
        New public methods for working with the brute force prevention
        system - loginFailure(), loginLimitExceeded(), getFailureTime(),
        setFailureTime(), getFailureCount() & setFailureCount().
        Cookie duration (in seconds) now required to be passed to the
        startSession() method.
	The login() logic now checks for an optional form field named
        'cookie_duration' which if present is passed on as the cookie
        duration argument of startSession().
        New config options login_frequency_limit, login_failure_limit,
        login_failure_period & login_failure_cooldown.
        New login errors login_cooldown_error & login_frequency_error.
        UserUnavailableUsernameException & UserUnavailableEmailException
        now extend RuntimeException instead of InvalidArgumentException

v1.1.2
    Bugs:
        Fixed a bug that was rendering setPassword() inoperable
    Documentation:
        Added an explanation of the numbering scheme to the entry for the
        VERSION constant in the man page.
        Corrected the entry for setEmail() to describe the two modes it may
        be invoked in.
        Fixed the default email regex quoted in the man page so the
        backslash in the pattern displays correctly.
        Minor formatting

v1.1.1
    Bugs:
        Fixed a bug causing login forms from login() to throw an exception
        on login attempts with non-existent usernames instead of failing
        gracefully and returning the form again with an error message

v1.1.0
    Security:
        Patched a potential XSS vulnerability in login() and register()
