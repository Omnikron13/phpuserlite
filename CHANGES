v1.1.2
    Bugs:
        Fixed a bug that was rendering setPassword() inoperable
    Documentation:
        Added an explanation of the numbering scheme to the entry for the

        Corrected the entry for setEmail() to describe the two modes it may
        be invoked in.

        Minor formatting

v1.1.1
    Bugs:
